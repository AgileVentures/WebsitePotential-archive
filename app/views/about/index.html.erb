<h1>About Us</h1>

<div>
  <br>Agile Ventures is a non-profit organization dedicated to crowdsourced learning and project development. </br>
  <br>
  Agile Ventures developers provide their services for free in order to further develop their IT skills and contribute to the greater good. All Agile Ventures developers work on an ad-hoc, volunteer basis and offer no guarantees of providing an actual
  IT solution. From an organisation's perspective it is best to think of collaborating with Agile Ventures developers for the purpose of better understanding the nature of the IT challenges faced. In favourable circumstances this may lead to Agile
  Venture developers being able to help craft a solution, but this should not be an assumed outcome. Agile Ventures itself will make every effort to help connect developers and non-profits for their mutual benefit, but also provides no guarantees of
  particular forms or quality of IT solutions. Both Agile Ventures as a community and individual Agile Ventures developers are committed to "Open Source" solutions. "Open Source" refers to the public visibility of the code for any solution on a code
  hosting service such as GitHub. "Open Source" refers only to the code, e.g. the Ruby, Python, JavaScript etc. that powers any solution. It does not refer to customer data, which can be secured when necessary. Agile Ventures also prefers an "Open
  Development" style in which all meetings with clients, planning meetings and programming sessions are recorded and made available on the AgileVentures website in order to achieve maximum transparency as to the development process. Naturally
  accommodations can be made for sensitive data, however Agile Ventures believes that a transparent process, including "Open Source" and "Open Development" supports mutual understanding on all sides, and provides valuable learning materials for all
  parties.
